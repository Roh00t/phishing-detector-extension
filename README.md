# Phishing Detection Browser Extension

## üõ°Ô∏è About the Project

This is a browser extension designed to detect potentially phishing URLs using basic heuristic rules. The current implementation is a skeleton (Phase 1) version, aimed to showcase the foundation of a phishing detection tool. It includes a minimal UI and basic detection logic, and is intended for personal testing and future development.
